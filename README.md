## Overview
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. 
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes,based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed
on the selection of these instances from a larger database.
In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
2From the data set in the (.csv) File We can find several variables, some of them are independent
(several medical predictor variables) and only one target dependent variable (Outcome).

### Dataset Descrption

Dataset used here is from a [Kaggle Dataset ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaydattatraykhare/diabetes-dataset). 

* **Features**:
  - Pregnancies: To express the Number of pregnancies.
  - Glucose: To express the Glucose level in blood. 
  - BloodPressure: To express the Blood pressure measurement. 
  - SkinThickness: To express the thickness of the skin. 
  - Insulin: To express the Insulin level in blood. 
  - BMI: To express the Body mass index. 
  - DiabetesPedigreeFunction: To express the Diabetes percentage. 
  - Age: To express the age.
  - Outcome: To express the final result 1 is Yes and 0 is No.
 
## Best Model selection

The data is trained on Logistic Regression,SVM , Decision Tree Classifier and  Random Forest Classifier. SVM turned out to be the best model with accuracy= 0.77.
